# My Solution

print(input().upper())


# Their solution didn'y under stand the question but it does the same thing. Kinda
# This is for multiple inputs, mine just takes one input

# lines = []
# while True:
#     s = input()
#     if s:
#         lines.append(s.upper())
#     else:
#         break;

# for sentence in lines:
#     print(sentence)
